I'm creating this so I can use my favorite settings that go by EnhancedDiscord's CSS file they created when they were around. They shut it down 04/12/2021, so I had time to go to their link and copy it, but I need a new link and I learned Github can do it.
04/11/2021 2:01am EST, I figured out I didn't need to do this, just had to put the code E.D. created at the bottom of the code it goes off of, so I can have the file forever with no worry.
